<b>Rose Whirl Doily</b></font><P><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>MATERIALS:</b><br>
For best results use: CLARK'S ONT. OR J. & P. COATS BEST Six CORD MERCERIZED CROCHET, Size 60:
<br><b>SMALL BALL:</b> CLARK'S O.N.T. OR J. & P. COATS -1 ball of White or Ecru.
<br><b>MILWARD'S:</b> steel crochet hook No. 13.
<br>Completed doily measures about 9 inches in diameter.
<br><b>Starting at center:</b> Ch 9, join with sl st, 1st rnd:</b> 16 sc in ring, sl st in 1st sc made.
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Sc in same place as sl st, * ch 5, skip 1 sc, sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 5.
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> * Sc in next sc, 2 sc in ch-5 sp, ch 4. Repeat from * around.
<br><b>4th to 15th rnds incl:</b> * Skip 1st sc, sc in each remaining sc of sc-group, 2 sc in ch-4 sp, ch 1. Repeat from * around (15 sc in each sc-group on last rnd</b>).
<br><b>16th rnd:</b> Ch 4, * skip 1 sc, sc in next 13 sc, ch 4, Sc in ch-4 sp, ch 4. Repeat from * around.
<br><b>17th rnd:</b> Ch 5, * skip 1 sc, sc in next 11 sc; (ch 5, sc in next loop) twice; ch 5. Repeat from * around. Continue in this manner, having 2 sc less in each sc-group and 1 loop more between sc-groups on each md, until 1 sc remains in each sc-group, and ending with ch 5, sc in loop preceding 1st sc.
<br><b>Now work as follows:</b>
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> * Ch 2, sc in next loop; (ch 5, sc in next loop) 7 times. Repeat from * around, ending with sc in loop preceding 1st ch-2.
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> * Ch 5, skip ch-2 loop, sc in next loop; (ch 5, sc in next loop) 6 times. Repeat from * around.
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> * Ch 5, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around.
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> * Ch 5, 6 dc in next loop; (ch 5, sc in next loop) 5 times. Repeat from * around, ending with sc in loop preceding 1st dc-group.
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> * Ch 5, sc between 3rd and 4th dc of d c-group; (ch 5, sc in next loop) 6 times. Repeat from * around.
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> * Ch 7, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around. Fasten off.
<br><b>FIRST ROSETTE:</b> Ch 10, join, 1st rnd:</b> 24 sc in ring; join.
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> * Ch 5, skip 3 sc, sc in next sc. Repeat from * around (6 loops).
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> In each loop around make sc, half dc, 3 dc, half dc and sc; join.
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> * Ch 5, sc in back 1oop of sc between this and next petal. Repeat from * around (6 loops).
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> In each loop around make sc ch 2, 7 dc, ch 2 and sc; join.
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Sl st in each of next 2 ch, sc in same place as last sl st, * ch 5, skip 3 dc, sc in next dc, ch 5, sc in 1st ch of next ch-2, ch 5, sc in 2nd ch of next ch-2. Repeat from * around; join to 1st sc.
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of 1st loop, sc in same loop, * ch 6, sc in next loop. Repeat from around; join.
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of 1st loop, sc in same loop. Ch 8, sc in 5th ch from hook (p), ch 3, sc in next loop (1 p-loop made). * Ch 5, sc in center of 1 loop on last rnd</b> of center piece ch 2, sc in 2nd ch of ch-5, ch 3, sc in next loop on rosette. Repeat from * 5 more times (6 loops joined). Make a p-loop in all remaining loops of rosette; join (12 free p-loops). Fasten off.
<br><b>SECOND ROSETTE:</b> Work 1st 7 rnd</b>s as for first rosette.
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of 1st loop, sc in same loop, make 1 p-loop; then join to 1st rosette as follows: Ch 5, sc in p of 2nd free loop after last joining on 1st rosette; (ch 2, sc in 2nd ch of ch-5, ch 3, sc in next loop on rosette, ch 5, sc in next p on 1st rosette) twice-this 3rd joining is made in the p of the last joining of 1st rosette to center-ch 2, sc in 2nd ch of ch-5, ch 3, sc in next loop on rosette. Join next 5 loops of 2nd rosette to next 5 loops on center in same way as 1st rosette was joined. Make a p-loop in all remaining loops of rosette; join (10 free p-loops).
<br>Make 11 more rosettes, joining in same way and taking care to join the last rosette on both sides.
