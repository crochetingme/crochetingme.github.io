A crochet bouquet doily is not only a stunning decorative piece but also a labor of love. It combines the artistry of crochet with the beauty of nature, creating a unique and eye-catching centerpiece that adds a touch of elegance and charm to any space. 				
				
				
<P><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>MATERIALS:</b>
Today most crocheters use the newer crochet thread. I would suggest you use what you have or what you can find. I use crochet cotton #10 on almost all my doilies. I usually use southmaid or Aunt Lydia's. There are many different brands. It will make about 14 inch doily with #10. crochet cotton and a size 11 hook.
<br><b>DAISY:</b> With Yellow ch 5, join to form a ring, ch 3 and work 17 dc in ring, join, break thread. 
<br><b>PETAL:</b> With White ch 14, insert hook in any dc, pull loop through, ch 1, 1 sc in next st of ch, 1 sdc in each of the next 3 sts (s dc: thread over hook, insert in st, pull loop through, thread over and work off all loops at one time), 1 dc in each of the next 9 sts, 6 sdc in end st, working on opposite side of ch, 1 dc in each of the next 9 sts, 1 sdc in each of the next 3 sts, 1 sc in next st, sl st in same dc, break thread. Skip 1 dc, work another petal in next dc. Continue working in same manner all around. Work a 2nd daisy same as 1st daisy, joining it to 1st daisy as illustrated.

Work all remaining forget-me-nots in same manner, always joining in center trc of petals.
<br><b>PANSY:</b> All pansies are worked in same manner, ch 7, join to form a ring, ch 3 (counts as 1 dc), 2 dc in ring, * ch 7, 3 dc in ring, repeat from * 3 times, ch 7, join.
