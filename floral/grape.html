<b>Grape Doily</b></font><P><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>MATERIALS:</b><br>
You can use any colors you wish. The grapes use about 500 yards of crochet cotton#10. The white is about 200 yards and the green about 400 yards. I used a  Steel Crochet Hook No. 7. The doily measures 14 inches in diameter. <br><br>
<b>Note:</b> I changed the grape instructions from dc's to trc's. Your grapes will come out much better.
