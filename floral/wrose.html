<b>Wild Rose Doily</b></font><br>
The overall design of the doily is intricate and detailed, with a combination of open spaces and solid stitches that create a visually appealing contrast. The edges of the doily are finished with a decorative border that complements the overall design and adds a final touch of elegance.

J. & P. Coats OR CLARK'S O.N.T. BEST SIX CORD MERCERIZED CROCHET, Size 30: Small Ball: J. & P. COATS-3 balls of White and 2 balls each of Shaded Pinks and Shaded Greens<br>or<br> CLARK'S 0.N.T.-5 balls of White and 3 balls each of Shaded Pinks and Shaded Greens
<br>Steel Crochet Hook No. 10. 
<br>Doily measures 13 inches in diameter 
<br><b>LARGE FLOWER:</b> With White, ch 20. 
<br><b>1st Rnd:</b> Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch across, 3 sc in end ch, sc in each ch along other side of starting chain. Ch 1, turn. Hereafter pick up back loop only of each sc. 
<br><b>2nd Rnd:</b> Sc in each sc to within 3 sc at tip, 2 sc in each of 3 tip sts, sc in each sc to end of row. Ch 4, turn. 
<br><b>3rd Rnd:</b> Skip the sc at base of ch and next 3 sc, sc in next sc, (ch 4, skip 3 sc, sc in next sc) 3 times; (ch 4, skip 2 sc, sc in next sc) 3 times; (ch 4, skip 3 sc, sc in next sc) 4 times. Break off. This completes one petal. Work first 2 rows of a 2nd petal as for first petal, ending with ch 2, turn. 
<br><b>3rd Rnd:</b> Sl st in end loop of first petal, ch 2, skip 3 sc on 2nd petal, sc in next sc, ch 2, sl st in corresponding loop of first petal, ch 2, skip 3 sc, sc in next sc, ch 4 and complete this petal same as first petal (no more joinings). Make 10 more petals, joining 2 loops of adjacent petals as before (join last 2 loops of last petal to first 2 loops of first petal). Break off. <br>Attach thread to base of any petal and, working toward center, make 2 sc-rnds, 1 dc-rnd and 1 sc-rnd, decreasing as necessary to keep work flat by working off 2 sts as one. 
<br><b>ROSETTE:</b> With Pink, ch 10, join. 
<br><b>1st Rnd:</b></b> * In ring make sc, half dc, 5 dc, half dc and sc. Repeat from * 4 more times (5 petals). 
<br><b>2nd Rnd:</b> * Ch 6, then, inserting hook from behind petals, work sc in ring between next 2 sc. Repeat from * around (5 loops). 
<br><b>3rd Rnd:</b> In each loop make sc, half dc, dc, 8 tr, dc, half dc and sc. Sl st in first sc made. Break off. Sew this rosette to center of Flower. 
<br><b>LEAF:</b> Starting at tip with Green, ch 15. 
<br><b>1st Rnd:</b> Sc in 2nd ch from hook, sc in each ch to within last ch, 3 sc in last ch; sc in each ch along opposite side of starting chain, sc in same place as last sc. Mark last sc for base of leaf. Hereafter pick up only the back loop of each sc. Do not turn but work sc in each sc to within 3 sc from center sc at tip of leaf. Ch 1, turn. 
<br><b>2nd Rnd:</b> Sc in each sc to marked sc, 3 sc in marked sc, sc in each sc on other side to within 3 sc from center sc at tip of leaf. Ch 1, turn. <br><b>3rd and 4th Rnds:</b> Sc in each sc to within center sc of 3-sc group, 3 sc in next sc, sc in each sc on other side to within last 3 sts. Ch 1, turn. 
<br><b>5th Rnd:</b> Same as 3rd row but making sc, ch 7 and sc in center sc of sc-group at base of leaf. 
<br><b>6th Rnd:</b> Sc in each sc to within ch-7 loop; 2 sc in loop, then pick up Flower and join leaf between 2 petals as follows: Ch 2, sl st in first loop to left of loop at tip of a petal, ch 2, 3 sc in ch-7 loop, ch 5, 3 sc in same loop, ch 2, sl st in corresponding loop of next petal, ch 2, 2 sc in ch-7 loop, sc in back loop of each sc across to within last 3 sts. Break off. Make 11 more leaves, joining each leaf between 2 petals of Flower as first leaf was joined.
<br> Attach White to loop at tip of a petal, * ch 7, sc in first corner st of adjacent leaf, (ch 7, sc in next corner st of same leaf) twice; ch 7, at tip of leaf make sc, ch 7 and sc; (ch 7, sc in next corner st of leaf) 3 times; ch 7, sc in loop at tip of next petal. Repeat from * around. Join and break off. <br>With Pink work a rosette as for center. Break off.
<br> Attach White to 5th st on any petal of a rosette, sc in same place, ch 7, skip 3 sts, sc in next st, then pick up doily and join rosette between 2 leaves as follows: Ch 3, tr in loop at tip of leaf, ch 3, sc in 5th st of next petal of rosette, ch 3, skip next loop on leaf, sl st in next loop, ch 3, skip 3 sts on rosette, sc in next st, ch 3, then, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr make tr in next loop on leaf and in corresponding loop on next leaf, thread over and draw through all loops on hook; ch 3, sc in 5th st of next petal, ch 3, sl st in next loop on leaf, ch 3, skip 3 sts on petal, sc in next st, ch 3, tr in loop at tip of leaf, ch 3, sc in 5th st of next petal, * ch 7, skip 3 sts, sc in next st, ch 7, sc in 5th st of next petal. Repeat from * once more. Join and break off. 
<br>Make and join 11 more rosettes in this manner. Now work a round of loops as follows: Attach White to tr-bar at right of loop which is at tip of leaf, ch 4, tr under next tr (at left of leaf), ** ch 3, sc in 3rd st from hook (picot made), ch 2, sc in next free loop on rosette, * ch 2, picot, ch 2, picot, ch 2, sc in next loop. Repeat from * 3 more times; ch 2, picot, then, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr make tr under next 2 tr, thread over and draw through all loops on hook. Repeat from ** around. Join last picot with sl st to 4th st of ch-4. Break off. With Green, work a leaf as before until the 5th row is completed. 
<br><b>6th Rnd:</b> Sc in each sc to within ch-7 loop; 2 sc in loop, then pick up doily and join as follows: Ch 2, sl st in 2nd picot preceding joined tr's between rosettes, ch 2, 3 sc in ch-7 loop of leaf, ch 5, 3 sc in same loop, ch 2, sl st in 2nd picot after same joined tr's, ch 2, 2 sc in ch-7 loop and complete leaf as before. 
<br>Make and join 11 more leaves in this manner. Make another leaf until the 5th row is completed. 
<br><b>6th Rnd:</b> Sc in each sc to within ch-7 loop, in loop make 2 sc, ch 5 and 3 sc; ch 2, sl st in sc above center petal of rosette, ch 2, 3 sc in ch-7 loop, ch 5, 2 sc in same loop, and complete leaf as before. Make and join 11 more leaves in this manner. 
<br><b>Now work 3 rnds of loops as follows: 1st Rnd:</b> Attach White to tip of a leaf which is joined between rosettes, ch 7, sc in same place, * (ch 7, sc in next corner st) 3 times; tr in next free loop of rosette, tr in free loop of next leaf, (ch 7, sc in next corner st) 3 times; ch 7, in tip of leaf make sc, ch 7 and sc; (ch 7, sc in next corner st) 3 times; ch 7, tr in free loop of leaf, tr in next free loop of rosette, sc in next corner st of next leaf, (ch 7, sc in next corner st) twice; ch 7, in tip of leaf make sc, ch 7 and sc. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 7, sl st where thread was attached. <br><b>2nd Rnd:</b> Sl st in next 3 ch, sc in loop, (ch 2, picot, ch 2, picot, ch 2, sc in next loop) twice; * ch 2, picot, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr make tr in each of next two ch-7 loops, thread over and draw through all loops on hook, picot, ch 2, sc in next ch-7 loop, (ch 2, picot, ch 2, picot, ch 2, sc in next loop) 6 times; ch 2, picot, then, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr, make tr in next two ch-7 loops, thread over and draw through all loops on hook, picot, ch 2, sc in next loop, (ch 2, picot, ch 2, picot, ch 2, sc in next loop) 4 times. Repeat from * around. Join last loop with sl st to first sc made. 
<br><b>3rd Rnd:</b> Sl st to center of next loop, sc in loop, ch 2, picot, ch 2, picot and ch 2; sc in next loop, * ch 3, sc between picots of next free loop, (ch 2, picot, ch 2, picot and ch 2, sc in next loop) 5 times; ch 3, sc between picots of next free loop, (ch 2, picot, ch 2, picot, ch 2, sc in next loop) 3 times. Repeat from * around. Join and break off.
