<br><b>Starting at center:</b> ch 10. Join with sl st to form ring. 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Ch 1, make 16 sc in ring. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 6, (tr in ring, ch 2) 15 times. Join to 4th ch of ch-6. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in joining, (ch 4, sc in next tr) 15 times; ch 2, hdc in first sc to form last loop. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 5, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr, make 5 tr in next loop, thread over and draw through all loops on hook-cluster made; ch 5, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 5, holding back on hook the last loop of each st, make 5 tr in next loop, dtr in first sc, thread over and draw through all loops on hook. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Ch 1, * sc in tip of cluster, ch 11. Repeat from * around. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in joining, * in next loop make (sc, ch 5) 5 times and sc; sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with (sc, ch 5) 5 times and sc in last loop. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of next loop, sc in same loop, * (ch 5, sc in next loop) 4 times; ch 3, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 1, hdc in first sc to form last loop. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Ch 5, make 4-dtr cluster in loop just formed, * ch 7, skip 1 loop, sc in next loop, ch 5, sc in next loop, ch 7, skip 1 loop, 5-dtr cluster in next ch-3 loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 7. Join to tip of first cluster. 
<br><b>9th rnd:</b> Ch 16, * dc in next ch-5 loop, ch 13, dc in tip of next cluster, ch 13. Repeat from * around. Join to 3rd ch of ch-16. 
<br><b>10th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in joining, * in next loop make (sc, ch 5) 5 times and sc; sc in next dc. Repeat from * around. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>11th rnd:</b> Repeat 7th rnd. 
<br><b>12th rnd:</b> Work as for 8th rnd, making ch 6 at each side of cluster instead of ch 
<br><b>13th rnd:</b> Ch 12, * dc in next ch-5 loop, ch 9, dc in tip of next cluster, ch 9. Repeat from * around. Join to 3rd ch of ch-12. 
<br><b>14th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in joining, * ch 5, in next loop make (sc, ch 5) twice; sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 2, dc in first sc. (96 loops). 
<br><b>Next 5 rnds:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 5, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending as on 14th rnd. 
<br><b>20th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop, * ch 5, 5-tr cluster in next loop, (ch 5, sc in next loop) twice. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 5. Join to first sc.
<br><b>21st rnd:</b> Sl st to tip of next cluster, ch 16, * dc in tip of next cluster, ch 13. Repeat from * around. Join as on 9th rnd. 
<br><b>22nd rnd:</b> Repeat 10th rnd.

<br><b>24th rnd:</b> Repeat 8th rnd. 
<br><b>25th rnd:</b> Ch 1, * sc in tip of cluster, ch 19. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>26th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in joining, * (ch 5, skip next 3 ch, sc in next ch) 4 times; ch 5, sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 2, dc in first sc.
